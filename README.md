# Exam-Reference-Sheets
 Preparing for exams? You'll find help here.

Everyone knows the craziness of exam time - suddenly, you're dying to find revision books you've never bothered to read, and you can't go without a day without your notebook. But what if you lose your notebook? What if your notes go missing? You forgot to take notes on an important topic? It's easy to panic if that happens - it's happened to me many times before.

That's why I've decided to electrify all of my notebooks and school notes. Just like the open-source community and the open design movement, I've decided to make all of my notes free to use and modify. Hopefully, once others benefit from these notes, they can also contribute to the notes on their own.

## Quick Start 

Currently, notes are available for the following subjects:

- [Honors Chemistry](Honors-Chemistry-Reference.md)

Read the notes by simply clicking on each of the notes. They can be downloaded as Markdown files (with the `.md` extension) and viewed offline as well.

## Work in progress 

- [ ] Change all KaTeX formulas to SVG images
	- Currently all KaTeX formulas are displayed verbatim as $$s which look horrible 
- [ ] Full documentation on how to edit, modify or use GitHub with notes

## Contribution

Contribution is really simple. You just need two things: a bit of time, and a text editor.

Firstly, **before you do anything**, read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It should take no more than 3 minutes. 

Next, start editing and writing! These notes are written in Markdown, which is very easy and fast to write, and can use a lot of themes. I personally use the [stackedit](https://stackedit.io) editor to edit these notes. Use whatever you see fit.

Remember that any contribution falls under the project's [license](LICENSE.md), to ensure that the project can remain free for all.
