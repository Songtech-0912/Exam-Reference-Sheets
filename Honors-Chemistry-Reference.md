## Required Formulas

Not finished yet, sorry!

## Required Symbols

* $\rho$ - stands for density, measured in mass/volume

## Atomic Models

* The definition of an atom has developed throughout history
* Our modern understanding of atoms is built on the theories of previous scientists
* Each had a different definition of an atom (could be same or different from our understanding today)

### Democritus

"Nuclear Model" - Most of the atom is empty space, but most of its mass is concentrated in the nucleus.

### Niels Bohr

Electrons orbit around the nucleus in discrete orbitals (shells) based on their energy level.

### Erwin Schrödinger

"Electron Cloud" - Electrons are located in arbitrary locations around the nucleus and and orbit in complex higher-dimensional non-Euclidean orbit.

## Subatomic Particles

### Nucleus

* The combined mass of the nucleons is called the atomic mass and is measured in atomic mass units (AMU)

### Protons

* The number of protons is the atomic number

### Neutrons

### Electrons

* In uncharged atoms, the number of electrons is equal to the atomic number
* In ions, the number of electrons is equal to the atomic number, minus the charge (e.g. a -2 charge with atomic number 5 has 5-(-2)=7 electrons)

### Isotopes

* To calculate the relative abundance of an isotope, use this formula:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases} A =  I_1x+I_2y \\ x+y=1 \end{cases}
  $$

Where $x$ and $y$ represent the relative abundance of each isotope, $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the given isotopes of an element, and $A$ is the actual atomic mass

* Example: The element Spidermanium is composed of two isotopes: $^{46}Sd$, which has an actual mass of 45.84 amu, and $^{43}Sd$, which has an acutal mass of 43.25 amu. If the atomic mass of Spidermanium is 44.25 amu, determine the percent abundance of the two isotopes.

$$
\text{Let $x$ and $y$ = \% abundance:} \begin{cases} A = 45.84x+43.25y \\ A= 44.25 \\x+y=1 \end{cases} \\
... \\
$$

$$
x=\left(\frac{100}{259}\right), y=\left(1-\frac{100}{259}\right) \\
$$

$$
x=38.6\%, y=61.4\%
$$

### Info to memorize

* Ions have more or less electrons than protons
* Uncharged atoms have the same number of electrons and protons
* Isotopes have a different number of protons and neutrons
* Atoms with the same number of electrons are isoelectronic

## Flame Tests

### Theoretical Knowledge

* When heat is applied to atoms, electrons gain energy
* The electrons are excited (rise to high energy levels), then fall to lower levels by releasing their energy

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fQ5Xjjk/Atomic-Emission-Process.gif" alt="Atomic-Emission-Process" border="0"></a>

* Example: Neon (Ne) releases an electron when excited

$$
\textit{Ne} \rightarrow \textit{Ne}^++e^-
$$

* The energy released is in the form of visible light

* We can detect the element based on the light emitted
  
  ### Practical Knowledge

* The most common flame tests:

## Acids and Bases

### Identifying Acids

### Identifying Bases

* Has an hydroxide ion ($\text{OH}^-$)

## States of Matter

* The main states of matter:
  * Solid
  * Liquid
  * Gas

|        | Appearance                                                         | Change of State                                     | Intermolecular Forces (IMF) |
|:------ |:------------------------------------------------------------------ |:---------------------------------------------------:| ---------------------------:|
| Solid  | Has unique shape independent of container, and has definite volume | Melting, Freezing; Sublimation, Deposition          | Strong                      |
| Liquid | Takes shape of container, but has definite volume                  | Vaporization, Melting                               | Strong                      |
| Gas    | Has no defined volume nor shape; can be colorless                  | Vaporization, Condensation; Sublimation, Deposition | Weak                        |

* Changes of State occur when an element gains or loses heat energy

## Electron Configuration

* Electron configuration is how the electrons are arranged within an atom
* Electron configuration is notated based on these rules:
  * Electrons orbit in specific *energy levels* (also called "shells") around the nucleus
  * Each shell can contain multiple *sub-energy levels*
    * The number of the shell determines how many energy levels it has
    * *E.g.* shell 1 has only 1 energy level, shell 2 has 2, etc.
* The sub-energy levels are called the $s$, $p$, $d$ and $f$ sub-energy levels:

$$
1s^2
$$

$$
2s^2\ 2p^6 
$$

$$
3s^2\ 3p^6\ 3d^{10}
$$

$$
4s^2\ 4p^6\ 4d^{10}\ 4f^{14}
$$

$$
5s^2\ 5p^6\ 5d^{10}\ 5f^{14}
$$

$$
6s^2\ 6p^6\ 6d^{10}\ 6f^{14}
$$

$$
7s^2\ 7p^6\ 7d^{10}\ 7f^{14}
$$

$$
\dots
$$

* Each sub-energy level has 4 more electrons than the previous level
  * *E.g.* $s=2$, $p=s+4\ (6)$, $d=p+4\ (10)$ 
* The superscripts ($2$ in $s^2$) indicate the maximum number of electrons in the sub-energy level 
* The electronic configuration of Iron ($_{26}\text{Fe}$) is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^6$
* This means that its electrons are arranged as 2. 8. 14. 2.

> Note that the $4s^{(2)}$ shell is usually written before the $3d^{(10)}$ shell

## Electron Diagonal Rule

* The electron diagonal rule shows the *location of electrons*
* It is a basic rule for writing the electronic configuration
* It states that:

> Electron configuration is written from *top to bottom* and *diagonal right to diagonal left*.

### Aufbau Principle

Start with lowest energy level first when writing out the electronic configuration

### Pauli Exclusion Principle

There can only be 2 electrons in each orbital with opposite spin

### Hund's Rule

Every orbital in a sub-energy-level is singly occupied before any orbital before any orbital is doubly occupied

### Orbital Rules

| Subenergy Level | Max no. orbitals                                                             | Max n. of electrons |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| $s$             | $\bigcirc$                                                                   | 2                   |
| $p$             | $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$                                             | 6                   |
| $d$             | $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$                       | 10                  |
| $f$             | $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ $\bigcirc$ | 14                  |

## Orbital Notation

* Orbital notation is just another way of writing electron configuration
* We represent each subshell as a circle $\bigcirc$ or square $\square$, with electrons represented as arrows $\uparrow$ $\downarrow$
* We use an up arrow $\uparrow$ for clockwise spin and a down arrow $\downarrow$ for counterclockwise spin
* For instance, these are the electron configurations, written in orbital notation, of nitrogen, oxygen, flourine and neon:

## Radioactivity

## Nuclear Equations

## Calculating Half Life

* Each radioisotope has a unique half-life, which is defined by this formula:

$$
M=P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/d} \\
\mathrm{Where}\\ d\ \mathrm{is\ the\ half-life,} \\
t\ \mathrm{is\ the\ number\ of\ years,} \\
P\ \mathrm{is\ the\ original\ amount,} \\
M\ \mathrm{is\ the\ final\ amount}
$$

## Ionization Energy

* **Ionization Energy** is the energy required to remove the outermost electron(s), resulting in a positive ion (cation)

* In general, elements with **more** outer shell electrons have **higher** ionization energy

* In the Periodic Table, there are 2 major trends for ionization energy:
  
  * Ionization Energy _increases_ from left to right
  
  * This is because the number of *protons* are increasing towards the right of the Periodic Table
  
  * Ionization Energy _decreases_ from top to down
  
  * This is because the number of energy levels _increases_ as you go down the Periodic Table

> 8 outermost electrons, also called an *octet*, is a very stable configuration. This results in a very high ionization energy (effectively impossible to achieve in real life). So, we can consider 8 outer shell electrons as unmovable.
