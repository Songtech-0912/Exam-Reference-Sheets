## The Gilded Age

## US Involvement in WW I

### Background of WWI

- Started as a dispute between Austro-Hungary and Serbia
- Later the Serbians pulled the Russians in (because of their secret alliances)
- The Austro-Hungarians pulled in Germany (because of their secret alliances)
- Devastating war because of deadly new weapons and obselete life-costing tactics

### American Neutrality

- President Wilson tries to keep Americans out of the war to influence postwar settlement
- However this became increasingly hard by 1917 because of worsening US-German relations and rising tensions:
  - Sinking of the _Lusitania_ ocean liner carrying American passengers to British, causing public outrage
  - Germans have unrestriced submarine warfare and fired on American ships
  - US loaned a lot of money to Britain/France and would be in debt if the Entente lost
  - Zimmerman telegram in which German allegedly offered for Mexico to attack the US
  - Anti-German sentiment rose in the Germany - Germans were called "Huns" and widely imprisoned
- Ultimately the US declared war on Germany on Jan 22, 1917

### Wartime Propraganda

- Wartime and patriotic pieces of music and film were produced by the US government
- **4 minutes men** - they appeared before every film, to recruit men for the war effort
