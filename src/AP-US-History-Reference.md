### Events

#### Federalist Era

- Three-Fifths Compromise - counted 3/5 of a state's enslaved population when determining a state's total population
  - Even though slaves could not vote, this gave Southern states a third more representatives and presidential votes
  - Not repealed until the Fourteenth Amendment
- Bill of rights
- Hamilton financial plans
  - Assumption of Debt
  - Bank of the United States - Hamilton establishes this via the elastic "neccesary and proper" clause

- Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions ("poison") - leads to Nullification of South Carolina in 1830s
- Washington's farewell address - **warns Americans of permanent alliances + political parties based on geographic location** - of course the US doesn't follow this!

#### Jeffersonian Era

- "Revolution of 1800" because Jefferson and Adams had a very fierce election - first successful PEACEFUL transition of power, integral in stabilizing the economy
- Toussaint L'Ouverture's successful overthrow - territory in Louisiana was no longer needed to plant crops to feed slaves, and Jefferson purchases it with the Louisiana Purchase
- Louisiana Purchase 
  - Controversial because the US was becoming expansionist and because it was claiming territory already inhabited by tens of thousands of Native Americans
  - Although Jefferson was somewhat hypcritical, doing so was eventually the right choice for the US because it gave it sovereignty and international recognition
- Embargo Act of 1807 - "Let's not trade with anyone!"
- War of 1812 - War Hawks support the war, Federalists didn't because they were trading with the British, and the British arms the native Americans - however it makes the federalist looks like fools - spells death for Federalist party, and leads to "Era of Good Feelings"

#### Era of Good Feelings

- American system - connect different parts of the country with transportation and a protective tariff to fund the transportation and industrialization
- Monroe Doctrine - says to European countries that they shouldn't interfere in North American affairs

- Missouri compromise - "a title page to a great tragic volume"
- Hartford Convention - federal listing of grievances, but eventually it made them look like fools and cowards

  - Jackson becomes known as the "people's president"
- In 1820s more and more men could vote including poor men BUT no women or enslaved blacks!
- Jackson's controversy:
  - Spoils System - surrounds him who are loyal to him - despotism and cronyism

  - Science, technology, democracy and divine guidance to help achieve perfection

- Women can save society
- Unlike First Great Awakening, free will played a key role in salvation
- Revivals which appealed to people's emotions
- Many conversions to Baptism and Methodism
  - Feminization of religion-middle class women very much involved in the movement, made up a majority of new church members--taught that women could play a key role in bringing their husbands and families back to God--in turn, save society
  - Mormonism-Joseph Smith (given the book of Mormon from an angel) later killed by an angry mob and Brigham Young (west to Utah)
    - Significant because it fostered nationalism (see this in the Hudson River School Art) and because it helped to spark the reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s
- Reform in the U.S. gained support from religious evangelicalism of the Second Great Awakening, and gave two critical beliefs
  - Perfectionism - American life could be reformed and rearranged to meet the moral requirements that God had set down for the perfect society
  - The saved Christian must to make his salvation complete by applying his/her religion to life
  - As Charles Grandison Finney wrote, "Each Christian should have the determination of being useful in the highest degree possible."

- Provided a basis for intellectuals to scrutinize and follow one's conscience
  - Emerson Thoreau-civil disobedience - will lead to Gandhi and Dr. King later
- Reform Movements:
  - Prison/Treatment of the Mentally Ill
    - Key activist: Dorothea Dix

* The Treaty of Geneva in 1954 ended the French Indochina War and split the country into North Vietnam, controlled by Vietnamese communists *(the Viet Minh)*, and South Vietnam, controlled by Vietnamese nationalists *(the Viet Nam)*
* Fighting between the two sides began to break out almost immediately afterwards, as both governments asserted themselves as the sole legitimate government of Vietnam
* Alleged North Vietnamese attacks on US naval warships in the Gulf of Tonkin started US forces into the war
  * They were not real attacks
  * But they were highly publicized and inspired nationalistic fervor (like 100 years ago in *remember the USS Maine*)
  * Johnson passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution unanimously - allow US action to protect themselves from attack under "whatever force necessary"

  * Ho Chi Minh Trail - Viet Cong escaped to Cambodia
  * Nixon decided to bomb Cambodia as a result - Christmas Bombings
  * Massive public outrage
  * Vietnam was the first *telivized war* - allowed people to form their opinions of what they were seeing e.g. My Lai massacre
  * Federal government tries to mislead people with the Pentagon Papers - told civilians one thing, actually did something else entirely different
  * High mistrust of government
  * 1975: US defeated, 58,000 soldiers are killed, and 365,000 Americans were wounded
  * Americans didn't welcome home the vets warmly and spat on them; many had PTSD and were not recognized for their services
* **Key takeaway:** Unlike the Korean War, which the US ended with a stalemate (and so technically *didn't* lose!), the Vietnam War was a complete defeat which made the war a national embarrasment far more than the Korean War

* Aimed at "Silent Majority" - ordinary Americans who don't want to take part in gender issues/social issues/racial issues, and want to go back to traditional values, who felt they were being ignored
  * Utilizes the "Southern Strategy" by Kevin Phillips
  * Phillips felt Americans had had enough of New Deal liberalism and elitism (based in the Northeast)
  * New conservative majority could be formed with Catholics, white Southerners, Sun Belt (old South and Texas, CA, NM, OK, AZ), and average middle class Americans. To borrow a ternm from the 1920s, they sought a "return to normalcy"
  * Nixon focused upon anger over civil rights gains and the liberalism of the Warren Court to attract voters Promised an end to the war in Vietnam and ironically, a return to law and order
* Rebirth of Conservative Ideas
  * Christian values instead of "moral decay"
  * Tradition instead of "excessive individualism"
  * Government should be an agent of moral regulation
* Nixon's foreign policy
  * Used the CIA to remove Allende from power and implement Pinochet as a right-wing dictator - "if he's not a communist, he's ok"

### Important Reminders

- Make sure you read the question **carefully**! Students can often mess up time periods!
  - For instance, the "19th century" is NOT the same as the 1900s!
Note - On SAQs (Short Answer Questions)
  - Answer format should be in Topic Sentence - Evidence - Analysis format
  - **Topic Sentence**
  - Answer the prompt in a clear, declarative sentence
  - **Evidence**
  - Name a piece of specific historical evidence, and explain
  - **Analysis**
  - Demonstrate how your evidence proves your topic sentence
- Exemplar: *Briefly describe ONE specific historical difference between the internal migration patterns within the United States in the period of 1910-1940 and the internal migration patterns in the period of 1941-1980*
  - **Topic Sentence**
  - One major difference with respect to internal migration between the two periods is the direction of the movement.
  - **Evidence**
  - For example, the Great Migration began in 1916 and from 1941-1980 there was a large migration to the Sunbelt States.
  - **Analysis**
  - The Great Migration was the movement of black southerners out of the South and into the Northeast and Midwest states for better living and working conditions, but the Sunbelt migration involved people from the North moving to the West, in many cases for jobs in the defense industry.
