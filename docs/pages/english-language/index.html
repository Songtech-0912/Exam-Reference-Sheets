# AP Language & Composition Notes

## Unit 1: Rhetoric

**Rhetoric** is *the study of writing or speaking as a means of communication or persuasion.*

* It is the study of effective communication through the understanding of:
  
  * the speaker 
  * the audience
  * the situation
  * the text

* Your rhetorical choices are shaped by your **message**, your **identity**, your **words**, your **audience**, and your **circumstances**. 

* Each aspect of rhetoric has an *interconnected effect* on each other. 

* A good communicator understands how these aspects connect and uses them accordingly based on the **rhetorical situation**. 

* There are many aspects in speaking and communicating that are involved in rhetoric, including:
  
  * our tone/attitude
  * our word choice/diction
  * use of imagery
  * allusions/references
  * evidence
  * mannerisms/gestures

### Analyzing the 5 aspects of rhetoric

#### 1. Rhetorical Situation

A series of conditions that a speaker takes in mind while writing or giving a speech. This includes:

* The speaker's message
* The speaker's identity
* The speaker's audience
* The circumstances of the speech

#### 2. Exigence

The issue, problem, or situation that causes or prompts someone to write or give a speech.

#### 3. Claim

The opinion, idea, or assertion held by the speaker and supported by evidence and/or persuasive means.

#### 4. Warrant

The unspoken assumption(s) recognized by the audience that one can base a claim on.

### Rhetorical Devices

Rhetorical Devices are proven strategies that increase the persuasiveness of rhetoric. Here are some of these devices:

#### Allusion/referencing

**Definition:** *A reference to a past event, text, or piece of art*

* Used to make a point by drawing connections or contrasts

* Can be subtle or direct

* Example:

> "Sometimes, my dog is Dr Jekyll; other times, he's Mr Hyde."

#### Repetition

**Definition:** *The repeated use of the same word, phrase or idea*

* Used to emphasize and create both a structural and emotional effect

* Usually very obvious and intentionally easy to spot

* Example:

> "I have a dream...I have a dream...I have a dream..."

#### Parallel Structure/parallelism

**Definition:** *The repetition of form, wording, or structure* 

* Used to give prose and poetry a sense of symmetry and balance

* Example:

> "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

#### Antithesis

**Definition:** *A form of parallelism, using words that are the opposites of, or strongly contrasted with, each other*

* Used to express a contrast or opposition of ideas

* Example: 

> "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."

#### Syntax

**Definition:** *The arrangement of words in a phrase or sentence, or the structuring of a sentence*

* Used to vary the author's language (i.e. make it less boring by not repeating words all the time), change the impact of a description, or strengthen certain points being made

* Syntax can also dictate where the reader reads and pauses

* Sometimes, the effect of syntax is not evident until you rearrange the sentence to something else

* Example:

> "What light from yonder window breaks? 

* The normal syntax of this sentence should be *what light is breaking from yonder window?* But Shakespeare deliberately *changes* the syntax to make a greater impact.

#### Ethos

**Definition:** *The level of credibility, authority, and respect of a speaker has while asserting a point*

* Used to convince or connect to an audience based on the authority or credibility of the persuader

* Example (italics added for emphasis): 

> "*As a doctor*, I am *qualified* to tell you that this course of treatment will likely generate the best results."

#### Metaphor & Simile

**Definition:** *Using an object, person, or idea to describe another, based on a shared property or trait*

* Used to suggest a likeness or analogy of the compared objects, people, or ideas

* Often grouped together and related to one specific topic

* Example:

> “Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.”

* Notice how many metaphors and similes in this quote are related to nature

#### Rhetorical Questions

**Definition:** *Questions addressed to the reader that are not meant to be answered in real time*

* Often, the question has an implied answer

* Used to signal an understanding of an author's point

* Example:

> "Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed, if you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?"

## Writing about and analysing rhetoric

AP English places a strong emphasis on the **speechmaker's/writer's awareness of the larger audience and broader ideas at play.** Here are some ways to show your understanding of rhetoric when analysing it:

* Repeating the word *audience* several times in your paragraph

* Making use of supporting evidence - as much as possible - is crucial
  
  * Supporting evidence needs to be *specific*, not a generalized reference

### Free Response Question Essay Structure

#### Introduction

1 sentence as opening statement - must be **arguable**, *not* just a statement of fact. This has to be a statement in the form of "*why* did this matter".

1-2 sentences providing context to your argument.

Contextualization (for historical-based essays only) - Mention specific references from a time period. How does it tie back to its thesis?

#### Body Paragraphs

Topic sentence: 1 sentence - use short snippets of supporting evidence

*The topic sentence cannot be too specific, such as "in this paragraph, the author uses metaphor for literary effects.". Something that specific will leave you with not enough to write about. It has to be about the **general effect** of the device, such as "within this paragraph, the author illustrates the emotional nature and significance of the main event, and meaning"* 

Evidence & Explanation: 3-4 sentences - use short quotes for supporting evidence and alternate between evidence and explanation. Do *not* confuse explanation with summary; explanation is *why* an author* makes a literary choice, rather than which choices they choose to make. Also, try to extract information from a single word or a single phrase, instead of a general sentence; in order words, be *discrimminating* in your use of evidence.

You **must** show understanding of rhetorical situation and factors influencing the work.

You **should** also include evidence beyond the document - the outside information and background knowledge.

Commentary: 2-3 sentences examining the effects of the author's literary choices. Use *smooth transitions* between each point to weave your analysis and your background information into your paragraph. You *must* communicate your ideas *clearly*, because the marking process for AP essays have no patience for tedious and unclear explanations.

Good word choices for contextualization/transition: elsewhere, alongside, beyond, hereafter, furthermore, equally importantly moreover; influences, represents, expresses, intends, demonstrates, illustrates, specifically, in any event, in the first place, in the second place, as a result, in brief, on the whole

#### Conclusion (no more than 4 sentences; no less than 2 sentences)

1 sentence summary of your thesis (shorter than your opening statement)

1-2 sentences of explaining "why my essay matters" such as:

* a universal truth explored in your essay

* a connection to another topic (how both are similar/different/affected each other)

* contrasting your essay with another topic

### Tips to quickly improve your writing

#### Improving sophistication

The sophistication score in AP is determined by whether you adhere to expected stylistic conventions. Among these are:

* Capitalization and use of title case 
* Using last names of authors and major characters
* Using appropriate transitional terms

Fixing any of the above is crucial in presenting you essay as a polished work.

#### Clarifying your thesis

Your thesis is the first thing that exam markers are going to see, so make sure it stands out. 

Firstly, you should avoid the following:

* Using too narrow a topic, such as one device
  * E.g. *The author's use of imagery in this work signifies...* is far too specific to be a topic sentence

Secondly, you are encouraged to do the following:

* Make your thesis directly about (or at the very least, *include*) the exigence of the work you are responding to
  * E.g. *Stoker utilizes the awareness of his position in comparison to Whitman to provoke the attention of Whitman* uses the exigence, *[for] provoking the attention of Whitman*
* Show awareness of the "bigger picture" of a work - that there's more to it that what's on a page
  * You can do this by either *addresing* the context of adding *personal experiences* to the original rhetorical work
  * E.g. *Ironically, Stoker became famous in later years, and we may find it unusual that he had been so hesistant in writing to Whitman in his youth*
